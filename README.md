# Dodger :car:
2D Java game based on dodging traffic for as long as possible, while other cars come towards you in three different lanes.

My first game I ever created in Java, which is a take on the games I used to play when I was younger.

## Setup

Clone this repository, then navigate to the `dodger-game` folder.
```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/chapmankyle/dodger-game.git

# navigate to the directory
cd dodger-game/
```

## Play

Unfortunately, it is only available to be played on linux. However, importing the project into some IDE on Windows
may allow you to play using the IDE "Play" button.

On linux, type the following in the terminal of your choosing:
```sh
# compile project
make
```
You should now be able to play! :tada:
